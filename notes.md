# 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
### Notes
i. UAVs/drones can be just as harmful as they are useful. While they can be used in search and rescue procedures or aerial photography, they can also be used to monitor private property or otherwise collect information that probably shouldn’t be collected.
ii. Dopamine releases essentially indicate to the brain that performing a certain action is beneficial, and should be done again in the future. This is how addictions are formed, and how applications like social media or video games can be both fun and harmful at once.
iii. Automated telephone trees are especially useful because it means that services can be offered to more people with less manual, human effort.
### Actions
1. Beneficial:
- The Internet allows a wide range of information to be readily available to anybody with Internet access
- The creation of automated programs or autonomous robots, etc. mean less manual work to solve problems
- Computer programs eliminate possibility of human errors (so long as the program does what it is intended to)
Harmful:
- Peoples’ personal information can also be investigated through the Internet, and used in harmful ways
- Automated robots taking over ‘unskilled labor’ jobs will eliminate job opportunities for many people, and create a greater divide between the rich and poor
- Society has become so dominated by technology that to lack access to tech means a disconnect from the world socially and economically
2. The ‘dopamine issues’ are not solely a ‘parent conspiracy’ considering they have scientific backing. Personally, I think technology has become something I use even if it is unnecessary because it is an easy escape from reality. However, excessive screen time is not healthy, and I recognize that it is best to take a break from electronics when I can.

# 5.2: Digital Divide
### Notes
i. In short, the “digital divide” describes the varying levels of access between different people or communities.
ii. Factors contributing to this divide include but are not limited to wealth, geographic location, level of education, nationality, or religion (Religious groups such as the Amish choose not to use technology).
### Actions
1. People can empower themselves in a digital world by understanding how to navigate and use the Internet safely, or if possible, learn to code or otherwise understand technology beyond the user level.
2. Someone that is empowered can help those who are not by offering them knowledge about and access to technology and the Internet. Students at Del Norte can do this by teaching others what they have learnt about programming in class.
3. “Red tape,” or rigid rules and protocols, can block digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are generally not barriers like this. For example, we have Chromebooks readily available for all students at the library. This may not be the case elsewhere, such as schools where Chromebook carts are not affordable.

# 5.3: Bias in Computing
### Notes
i. “Bias in computing” describes the biases that exist in various technology as a result of developers’ oversight when it comes to inclusivity, etc. This can be either unintentional or intentional, but is often harmful regardless of intention.
### Actions
It seems like the owner of the computer does not think the webcam was intentionally made not to pick up black peoples’ faces, because he is joking around about it.
I think this must have happened because the developers did not test the webcam sensors on black peoples’ faces. Their test subjects may have only been people with light skin, which is why it picks up the black man’s coworkers’ face, but not his.
This likely was not intentional, but it can be harmful because the black man cannot make use of the webcam the same way that his white counterparts can.
Yes, the webcam sensors should be able to detect all users’ faces regardless of skin color.
To fix this issue, the developers should include a more diverse range of test subjects, so that their product can meet the needs of a greater range of users.

# 5.4: Crowdsourcing
### Notes
i. Crowdsourcing is a practice which involves calling upon a wide range of people to offer data. Crowdsourcing is beneficial because it allows the data set to be inclusive of a wider range of perspectives, and can also improve its accuracy (Large sample size, greater accuracy).
ii. Wikipedia is an example of crowdsourcing. Anybody on the Internet can create an account and add to or edit the articles on Wikipedia. Though this means the site can have inaccuracies, its “self-policing” community generally keeps things reliable. It also allows for its large variety of articles to be regularly updated, meaning many Wikipedia articles are probably more reliable than, say, an old encyclopedia.
iii. In class, we have had a taste of crowdsourcing by obtaining and using data from RapidAPI. We have also participated in crowdsourcing by using Github (forking repositories, etc.).
### Actions
1. To crowdsource out of our computer science classes, students can survey each CS student or allow some database to be available to all students to contribute to.
2. Crowdsourcing from the entire Del Norte student body would likely offer a more well-rounded collection of data than if we restricted the crowdsourcing to STEM students. A greater variety of students can offer a greater variety of perspectives and ideas.

# 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns
### Notes
i. When borrowing from code or other resources online, programmers need to know how the content is licensed, because to use content created by others may risk some ethical or legal concerns.
ii. When licensing their work, one should ask the following questions:
- Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse?
- Do I want to allow derivative works or not?
- Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared?
iii. The types of licenses include:
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal—waives copyright interest in a work you've created, and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain.
- Open Source MIT License—allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions.
- Open Source GPL License—allows most things except distributing closed source versions.
iv. Generally, using others’ code in a computer science class would be okay because it is for educational purposes. This may be a different story in cases where, say, you are developing a product which you will monetize.
### Actions
(I have already taken notes to cover no. 1 under Actions.)
For our team project (and my personal project), my team members and I have chosen the Open Source GPL License, because we do not want people distributing closed source versions of our project, nor do we want to waive copyright interests or etc.

# 5.6: Safe Computing
### Notes
i. As a user of the Internet, it is more than likely that you have searchable, personal identifiable information on the Internet. It is important that you keep confidential what may harm you for others to know.
ii. 2-factor authentication (e.g. texting users a code for an extra level of identity verification) can help users keep their online accounts secure.
iii. Malware can be installed on your device if you click suspicious links on the Internet. Another example of online attacks or harm is phishing, where unknown sources try to coax you into giving them your personal information.
iv. Biometrics (e.g. use of fingerprints or face scans for identification) are sometimes used for an extra layer of security.
v. Symmetric encryption is when one key is used to both encrypt and decrypt information. On the other hand, asymmetric encryption is when both a public and private key is used to protect information.
### Actions
1. Personal information we have included in our computer science projects include the names, photos, and descriptions on the ‘About Me’ pages we created.
2. I don’t feel that I have anything too important circulating on the Internet (nothing comes up when I try a name search, etc.) but sometimes I worry about people taking my artwork and claiming it as their own.
3. A good password likely includes letters, numbers, and special characters or otherwise is challenging to guess or cover with algorithms that test varying combinations of characters. Alternative steps to assist in authentication is perhaps sending a text to the user’s phone, or an email to the user’s email account.
4. Symmetric encryption is when one key is used to both encrypt and decrypt information. On the other hand, asymmetric encryption is when both a public and private key is used to protect information.
    5. In deployment, images off of AWS had keys required to SSH into them.
6. Phishing is basically when somebody tricks a user into revealing personal information by pretending to be credible in some way or another. I have not been phished, so I wouldn’t personally know, but generally people would do this to attain credit card information, etc.
